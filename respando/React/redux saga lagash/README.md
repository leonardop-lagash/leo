# React Web App boilerplate with CRA, Redux and Saga

## Who's the Starter for?

This starter is for those with basic knowledge of React and Redux have the need for building a mature React Application with state requirements in Lagash. You can treat this application as an example of how a non-trivial app needs to be structured.
If you feel intimidated by all the understanding needed to develop a complex application, dont' worry, we've been all there!
See it as an opportunity to learn lot of cool stuff and also to interact with your team mates in Lagash.

The version with complete examples can be found [here](https://gitlab.lagash.com/quickstarts/create-react-app-redux-saga-material-ui).

If you need you create a trivial application, without retrieving information from any source, this may be overkill. If you have any doubts, ask! Don't be shy.

## Requirements

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.0
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 6.0

## Getting Started

**1. You can start by cloning the repository on your local machine by running:**

```bash
git clone --depth=1  https://gitlab.lagash.com/starters/create-react-app-redux-saga-classic.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

**2. Install all of the dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Start to run it:**

```bash
npm start           # Runs development mode
npm run start:prod  # Runs production mode
```

At this point you can see the example app at http://localhost:3000

**4. Running tests:**

```bash
npm test          #runs unit tests
npm run e2e:open  #runs end to end tests
npm run e2e:run   #runs end to end tests (CI environment)
```

**5. Code checks/linting:**

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

**6. NPM check dependencies:**

```bash
npm install -g npm-check
npm-check -u
```

## Tech Stack

As stated before, this _boilerplate_ aims to the development of modern and rich application and thus requires modern tools and techniques.

If you're completely new to React, please refer to the [react-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto). Its a great starting point.

Here's a curated list of packages that you should be at least familiar with before starting your project. However, the best way to see a complete list of the dependencies is to check [package.json](https://gitlab.lagash.com/starters/create-react-app-redux-saga-classic/blob/master/package.json).

## Setup React Dev Tools

Follow the instructions given [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)

## Setup Redux DevTools Extension

The [Redux Devtools Extension](http://extension.remotedev.io/) let us wire up our Redux app to a time-traveling debugger. It's enabled in development only. You can follow these installation guides to use it:

**For Chrome**

- from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd);
- or build it with `npm i && npm run build:extension` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./build/extension`;
- or run it in dev mode with `npm i && npm start` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./dev`.

**For Firefox**

- from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/)
- or build it with `npm i && npm run build:firefox` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) `./build/firefox` (just select a file from inside the dir).
